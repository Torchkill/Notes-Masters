## Academic content

__Purpose__
For students to obtain an understanding of both the theoretical concepts and practical applications within Statistical Learning. Offering a comprehensive introduction to a variety of popular and essential statistical methods and learning techniques, the course is designed to prepare students for more advanced machine learning courses. With a strong emphasis on practical applications, the course integrates theoretical concepts whenever they can enhance student comprehension. Students will develop the necessary skills to analyze large datasets, and learn to select the most appropriate methods for different scenarios. Additionally, they will learn several useful techniques for data visualization.

__Learning outcomes__
Upon completing the course, students should be able to:
o	Disscuss and explain the fundamental concepts of statistical learning.
o	Implement and discuss both simple and multiple linear regression techniques to analyze datasets.
o	Implement and discuss various classification methods, such as logistic regression, generative models for classification, and generalized linear models.
o	Justify the use and apply regularization techniques.
o	Discuss and compare core concepts involved in model evaluation and selection.
o	Utilize resampling methods such as cross-validation and bootstrap.
