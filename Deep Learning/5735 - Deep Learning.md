## Academic content

__Purpose__
The aim of the course is for the student to acquire a broad understanding of advanced concepts and architectures in neural networks, with a focus on deep learning techniques. The student will gain the skills to independently use optimization algorithms, regularization methods, and modern neural network models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, for tasks in the real world. Additionally, the student will develop the ability to critically assess the performance, usage, and limitations of these models in AI research and industry.

__Learning outcomes__
Upon completing the course, students should be able to: 

 - 	Explain the fundamental principles of deep neural networks.
 - 	Apply gradient descent algorithms, backpropagation and regularization techniques to optimize neural networks.
 - 	Explain the working principles of Convolutional Neural Networks and their applications in computer vision.
 - 	Explain the working principles of Transformer models and their applications in Natural Language Processing.
 - 	Analyze strength and limitations of a model for a given setting.
 - 	Complete a project and interpret results by use of computational framework for GPU programming such as PyTorch.
 - 	Structure and write a coherent and clear technical report on the project work.

__Content__
ed overview of deep neural networks, including architectures and principles.
 - 	Optimization methods such asgradient descent methods.
 - 	Backpropagation and its role in training deep neural networks.
 - 	Methods for preventing overfitting in neural networks, including weight decay, dropout, and early stopping.
 - 	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, commonly used in image processing tasks.
 - 	Transformer architectures, the attention mechanism, and applications in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
 - 	Introduction to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their application in structured data.

__Learning and teaching approaches__
Lectures, exercises, projects, group work, self-study

## Assessment

__Assessment method__
An assignment and a project must be done during the course. The assignment and a project report must be submitted, and the student must have passed both by the specified deadlines to be eligible for the exam. The final exam is oral, with no preparation time. In the first half of the exam, students defend their project report, and in the second half, we discuss questions from the curriculum, which the students draw at random. No aids are allowed during the exam, except for a copy of the report. The oral exam counts for 100% of the final grade. The re-examination follows the same format.

__Examination (internal/external)__
External

__Grading scale__
7-scale

__Exam date/dates__
The exam hand-in will be 05/06-2026. The oral exam will be 18/06-2026 and 19/06-2026.

__Deadline for withdrawal from exam__
