## Academic content

__Purpose:__
The aim of the course is to provide students with a broad understanding of wireless communication — from theoretical description, to simulation, and finally to practical implementation. The course describes differences between communication environments such as mobile networks, IoT, and satellite communication, enabling students to analyse wireless systems under real-world conditions.

__Learning outcomes:__
After completing the course, the student should be able to:
 -  Describe communication over shared radio channels, including noise, fading, and attenuation/amplification.
 -  Explain the principles and differences between various types of modulation and medium access control (MAC).
 -  Describe quality of service (QoS) in wireless systems.
 -  Describe mobile network architecture and the role of the radio spectrum.
 -  Evaluate principles and challenges related to security in wireless and IoT systems.
 -  Assess sustainability in different routing strategies based on system configuration and performance requirements.
 -  Apply simulation and laboratory experiments to connect theoretical models with real-world communication systems.

__Content:__
The course covers fundamental concepts in wireless communication, such as signal processing, noise, modulation, and medium access control (MAC). It then continues with channel modelling, propagation, and interference. Security aspects and IoT protocols are also addressed.

__Learning and teaching approaches:__
Teaching is organized through lectures, discussions, practical experiments, and hands-on assignments. Part of the instruction may be delivered online.

## Assessment

__Assessment method:__
To qualify for the final exam, each student must submit 3 approved assignments. An assignment is considered approved if the practical component functions as intended, and at least 80% of the questions are answered correctly.

The final examination will be a 4-hour written exam. During the written exam, electronic devices are not permitted. Printed and handwritten materials are allowed, such as notes, assignments, lecture materials, and textbooks. The re-exam is conducted as an oral examination.

__Examination (internal/external):__
External

__Grading scale:__
7-scale

__Exam date/dates:__
The written exam will be in week 15, 2026.

__Deadline for withdrawal from exam:__
Tuesday, February 3, 2026
