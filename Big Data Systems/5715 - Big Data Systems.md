## Academic content

__Purpose__

Enable the students to manage and analyse big data by providing them with knowledge and practical know-how about big data system technologies.


__Learning outcomes__

When the course is over the student should be able to:
 - 	Explain and reason about fundamental concepts in big data such as big data characteristics, multidimensional data and OLAP vs. OLTP.
 - 	Explain and reason about multidimensional data storage together with the management of multidimensional data.
 - 	Explain, use, and reason about fundamental multidimensional modelling.
 - 	Explain and with OLAP-tools set up a data warehouse with data from several data sources using e.g., ETL.
 - 	Explain and reason about fundamental distributed storage of heterogeneous data with e.g., Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
 - 	Explain and reason about different methods for increasing fault-tolerance.
 - 	Explain and perform distributed data analysis of big data with e.g., MapReduce and Apache Spark.
 - 	Explain, discuss, and perform OLAP-queries with tools such as Apache Spark or Multi Dimensional Expressions (MDX).
 - 	Explain specialized database systems (NoSQL) such as key-value, document, time series or graphs stores.


__Content__

 - 	Big data characteristics and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) vs. Online Transactional Processing (OLTP).
