## Academic content

__Purpose:__
Enable the students to manage and analyse big data by providing them with knowledge and practical know-how about big data system technologies.

__Learning outcomes:__
When the course is over the student should be able to:
 - 	Explain and reason about fundamental concepts in big data such as big data characteristics, multidimensional data and OLAP vs. OLTP.
 - 	Explain and reason about multidimensional data storage together with the management of multidimensional data.
 - 	Explain, use, and reason about fundamental multidimensional modelling.
 - 	Explain and with OLAP-tools set up a data warehouse with data from several data sources using e.g., ETL.
 - 	Explain and reason about fundamental distributed storage of heterogeneous data with e.g., Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
 - 	Explain and reason about different methods for increasing fault-tolerance.
 - 	Explain and perform distributed data analysis of big data with e.g., MapReduce and Apache Spark.
 - 	Explain, discuss, and perform OLAP-queries with tools such as Apache Spark or Multi Dimensional Expressions (MDX).
 - 	Explain specialized database systems (NoSQL) such as key-value, document, time series or graphs stores.

__Content:__
 - 	Big data characteristics and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) vs. Online Transactional Processing (OLTP).
 - 	Multidimensional modelling. Relational storage of the multidimensional model together with storage optimizations. Multidimensional queries.
 - 	Setting up a data warehouse and integrating data from several data sources using Extract-Transform-Load (ETL). Data warehouse management.
 - 	General introduction to distributed data storage.
 - 	Replication and consistency of distributed data storage.
 - 	Big data analysis.
 - 	Specialized database systems (NoSQL).
