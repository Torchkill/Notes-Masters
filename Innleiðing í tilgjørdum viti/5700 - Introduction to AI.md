## Academic content

__Purpose__
The purpose of this course is to give the student an understanding of introductory concepts and design principles in Artificial intelligence, with a focus on symbolic AI. The course provides the student with the tools to independently determine and apply the relevant techniques within search, logic, probability and optimisation techniques to a given AI problem. Moreover, the student will be able to identify and discuss applications, challenges, and societal implications of AI.

__Learning outcomes__
On completion of the course, students will be able to demonstrate ability to:
-Identify and discuss strength and weaknesses of symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches in AI.
 -Analyze and compare the effectiveness of different search and optimization techniques, including uninformed, informed, adversarial search, and hill-climbing methods.
-Assess and implement in Python heuristics, optimization algorithms, and game evaluation functions.
-Assess and implement in Python inference techniques in a probabilistic setting.
-Evaluate which type of problems and settings require the application of data-driven or knowledge-based techniques.
-Recognise and discuss the role of search, logic, optimisation and probabilistic reasoning in current AI research and modern technology.
-Evaluate and discuss the societal, ethical, and legal implications of AI, and common biases in AI models.

__Content__
 - 	Definition of AI. 
 - 	Symbolic versus sub-symbolic AI. Intelligent agents and search problems. Informed and uninformed search, heuristics, adversarial search, and games. 
 - 	Knowledge and logic. Propositional and first order logic, inference rules and techniques (modus ponens, model checking, resolution), theorem proving, belief revision. Inference in a probabilistic setting. Bayes rule and Markov models.
 - 	Optimization techniques, including local search and  hill-climbing, and constraint satisfaction problems.
 - 	Overview of applications of search, logic, and probability in real world AI technology.
 - 	General introduction to machine learning. 
 - 	AI bias and fairness, societal and ethical implications.

__Learning and teaching approaches__
Lectures, exercises, assignments, self-study.

## Assessment

__Assessment method__
The assessment is based on the following: two mandatory assignments to be submitted in accordance with deadlines, and an oral examination – without preparation – which counts for 100% of the grade. The oral exam will cover the whole content of the course. Moreover, the students will receive formative feedback about the assignments, as they will be asked to defend them during the oral exam; assignments should therefore be handed in timely before the examination.

__Examination (internal/external)__
External

__Grading scale__
7-scale

__Exam date/dates__
The oral exam will be on the 23/10 and 24/10, 2025.
The reexam is set for week 2, 2026.

__Deadline for withdrawal from exam__
Monday, August 25, 2025
