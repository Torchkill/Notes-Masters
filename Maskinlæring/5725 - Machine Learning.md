## Academic content

__Purpose__
The purpose of the course is to enable students to build foundational knowledge in machine learning, and to learn about various machine learning methods and their practical applications. Students will gain a theoretical foundation as well as the skills necessary to implement machine learning algorithms. Through hands-on experience, they will be equipped to solve real-world problems and analyse complex datasets effectively.

__Learning outcomes__
Upon completing the course, students should be able to: 

 - 	Discuss and explain fundamental concepts of machine learning.
 - 	Implement and discuss the machine learning techniques in the course.
 - 	Implement machine learning methods using a programming language.
 - 	Analyse and assess the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning methods.
 - 	Visualize and interpret the results of the machine learning methods.

__Content__
 - 	Ensemble methods
 - 	Support vector machines (SVM)
 - 	Bagging
 - 	Boosting
 - 	Tree-based methods
	 - 	Decision trees
	 - 	Random forest
 - 	Unsupervised learning
	 - 	Clustering
	 - 	Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
	 - 	Anomaly detection
 - 	Recommender systems
 - 	Elements of Reinforcement learning
 - 	Practical machine learning
	 - 	Data considerations
	 - 	Machine learning pipeline 
 - 	Practical work

__Learning and teaching approaches__
Lectures, exercises, group work, self-study

## Assessment

__Assessment method__
Two projects are required for submission: the first project is due at the midpoint of the course, followed by a final project. Students must pass both projects by the specified deadlines to qualify for the examination. The final exam is an oral assessment conducted without prior preparation. During the first half of the exam, students defend their final project. In the second half, they answer questions from the curriculum, drawn at random. The oral exam accounts for 100% of the final grade.

__Examination (internal/external)__
External

__Grading scale__
7-scale

__Exam date/dates__
The exam hand-in is on the 18/12, 2025. The oral exam will be on the 12/01 and 13/01, 2026.
The reexam is set for week 14, 2026.

__Deadline for withdrawal from exam__
Monday, October 27, 2025
